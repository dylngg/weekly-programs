# weekly-programs
 ~~Every week I create a random program that does something... I try to upload my program every sunday the week after but I often forget... Below is the description of what each program does.~~


For 27 weeks, I created a new program. The goal of this experiment was to learn python, and after creating a new program every 27 weeks, I've found that I have certainly acomplished that goal. My goal now, is the learn the language further than just some scripts. I need to build things that are more advanced, and focus on things that truely challenge me. In order to do this, I need to devote more time to doing advanced programs, and the weekly programs are a precious amount of time that I could spend working on things bigger than just a script. So for now, I am no longer going to create a weekly program, and instead focus on things that challenge me.

  - It's Christmas Time! Program creates a text based cristmas tree.
  - Usage *treeTester.py -x WIDTH -y HEIGHT -c CHAR -o ORNAMENT*

* Week 20 (12/26/16)
  - Get bored often? Jump down in a internet rabbit hole! This program gets a interesting wikipedia article and either prints or opens the website up.
  - Usage: *wiki_rabbit_hole.py -a NUM OF ARTICLES -o OPEN IN BROWSER?(y/n)*

* Week 22 (1/9/17)
  - Need Trump Ipsum text? Me either. Here it is anyways! The program generates trump ipsum based on his tweets.
  - Usage *trump_ipsum.py -p NUM OF PARAGRAPHS*

* Week 23 (1/16/17)
  - An totally new program based off of my biggest files program (week02). It's more efficent and doesn't look like garbage.

  - A class and program that generates a random number, with the option to set the values of the dice, and the number of values the dice holds.
  - Usage *roll_a_dice.py -d NUM OF DICE -f NUM OF DICE FACES -s SET DICE FACES*

* Week 26 (2/6/17)
  - A progrom that sorts lists using the quicksort algorithm, with options to generate a list or input your own.

## Side Note
* Just as a side note, I am a inexperienced programmer who is trying to learn Python, so if you have any suggestions on how to make a weekly program better or more efficent, you can help me by creating a pull request with the improved program in the 'improvements' branch. Make sure that you thoroughly comment and explain how everything works :). I'd love to use these programs to learn how I can improve and learn more about programming. Thanks!
