# weekly-programs
Every week I create a random program that does something... Below is the description of what each program does.



## Descriptions
* Week 1 (8/14/16)
  - Generates gibberish at whatever length you want.

* Week 2 (8/22/16)
  - Finds the biggest files in a directory.


## Side Note
* Just as a side note, I am a inexperienced programmer who is trying to learn python, so if you have any suggestions on how to improve a weekly program, you can contribute by creating a pull request with a improved program in the 'improvements' branch. Make sure that you thoroughly comment and explain how everything works :). I'd love to use these programs to learn how I can improve and so that I can learn more about programming, Thanks.
