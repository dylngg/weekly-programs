# weekly-programs
Every week I create a random program that does something... Below is the description of what each program does.



## Descriptions
* Week 1 (8/14/16)
  - Generates gibberish at whatever length you want.

* Week 2 (8/22/16)
  - Finds the biggest files in a directory.
  
* Week 3 (8/29/16) 
  - Encrypts sentence by replacing all words with another word in dictionary.
  - Requires no spaces, and all words have to be in the English dictionary.

* Week 4 (9/5/16)
  - Finds all words in a website.
  - Requires module bs4 and requests

* Week 5 (9/12/16)
  - A program that forces you to make a decision on the items you can't decide on.

## Side Note
* Just as a side note, I am a inexperienced programmer who is trying to learn python, so if you have any suggestions on how to make a weekly program better or more efficent, you can help me by creating a pull request with the improved program in the 'improvements' branch. Make sure that you thoroughly comment and explain how everything works :). I'd love to use these programs to learn how I can improve and learn more about programming, Thanks.
